# Benchmarks

Measured on Linux x86_64. Numbers are medians; your machine will differ,
but the method below keeps them reproducible.

## Headline numbers

| Case | rdsh | Baseline | Factor |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| `--version` startup (median, n=5) | ~0.90ms | original `dsh` ~88ms | ~98x |
| `--version` peak RSS | ~2.9MB | original ~66MB | ~1/23 |
| Hook-equivalent peak RSS | ~2.7MB | equivalent Node script ~45MB | ~1/16 |
| search (300 files, ~600k lines) | ~17ms | before ~41ms | ~2.4x |
| tokens (9.6MB text) | ~12ms | before ~35ms | ~2.9x |
| sessions --tokens (20 sessions) | ~0.41s | before ~1.65s | ~4.0x |
| Distribution size | one ~806KB binary | ~508MB Node tree | -- |

## How to reproduce

```sh
rdsh bench --n 5
/usr/bin/time -v rdsh --version
/usr/bin/time -v dsh --version
```

Before/after binaries were built from HEAD vs. the working tree in a scratch
worktree and their outputs were diffed for equality.

## Rules for benchmark PRs

1. State machine, OS, and `n`.
2. Paste raw output, not just the summary table.
3. Prove output equality (diff before/after outputs).
4. Update this file when a headline number moves by more than ~10 percent.
